# skin-disease-recognition

This project aims to classify different types of skin diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It provides a web interface where users can upload an image and receive predictions about the skin condition.

Overview
Skin diseases can be difficult to diagnose accurately without specialist knowledge. This project leverages deep learning to automate the classification process, making it easier for users to detect potential skin conditions based on image inputs.

The model is trained to classify images into 7 categories:

Acne and Rosacea

Actinic Keratosis and Basal Cell Carcinoma

Atopic Dermatitis

Bullous Disease

Eczema

Melanoma, Nevi, and Moles

Urticaria (Hives)
